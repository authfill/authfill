# Terms of Service

_Last Updated: June 8, 2025_

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **AuthFill**! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the AuthFill browser extension ("AuthFill", "we", "our", "us"). AuthFill is a tool that automates the extraction and autofill of One-Time Passwords (OTPs) or verification links from configured email accounts (IMAP or Google OAuth).

By using AuthFill, you agree to these Terms.

## 2. Use of AuthFill

AuthFill allows users to retrieve and autofill OTPs or verification links directly from their own email accounts. It supports:

- **Google accounts** via secure OAuth authentication
- **IMAP accounts** via a hosted proxy at `proxy.authfill.com`, which uses WebSockets and IDLE commands to fetch and monitor new emails

The extension works by scanning incoming emails for verification codes or links and presenting them to the user for quick use.

## 3. Data Handling and Privacy

We do **not** permanently store any personal data, email content, OTPs, or login credentials. All data is processed either:

- **Locally in your browser**, or
- **Temporarily via our hosted proxy (`proxy.authfill.com`)**, where email content is accessed for a short period solely to extract the necessary verification data.

The proxy does not persist or log your data beyond the temporary processing needed to fulfill the request.

Our full Privacy Policy is available at: [authfill.com/privacy](https://authfill.com/privacy)

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree not to use AuthFill for any unlawful, harmful, or abusive purposes, including but not limited to:

- Unauthorized access to email accounts
- Phishing, spoofing, or impersonation
- Circumventing verification or security systems
- Harvesting OTPs or verification data from third parties without consent

We reserve the right to restrict or revoke your access if you violate these terms.

## 5. No Warranty

AuthFill is provided "as is" and "as available", without warranty of any kind. We do not guarantee that the extension will always operate error-free, remain available, or be free from vulnerabilities. You use it at your own risk.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the creators of AuthFill (Simon Köck and Paul) disclaim all liability for any damages, losses, or claims arising from your use of the extension or services.

## 7. Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms periodically. If changes are made, we may notify you via the extension or our website. Continued use of AuthFill after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
