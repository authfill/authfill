\*AuthFill supports any email provider with IMAP access and plain-text password authentication. This includes Gmail, Outlook, and most custom domain email services.

\*\*Due to a technical limitation of browser extensions, AuthFill has to temporarily proxy data through our servers to establish the IMAP connection and fetch your emails. However, your credentials and emails are never permanently stored and remain strictly confined to the processing step. Everything else stays local on your device.
